# Fluorescence Tracker App
This app uses computer vision point tracking to quantify near infrared signals emitted by (ICG) Indocyanine Green during fluorescence angiography.

The following research in colorectal cancer was carried out using this software: ["Digital Dynamic Discrimination of Primary Colorectal Cancer using Systemic Indocyanine Green with Near-infrared Endoscopy"](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-148596/v1) by Jeffrey Dalli et al., UCD Centre for Precision Surgery, School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Ireland (2021).

## Requirements
* MATLAB R2020b (or newer)
* Image Processing Toolbox, Computer Vision Toolbox, and Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
* Please see the Fluorescence Tracker App User Guide for video format requirements

## Installation and Setup
* Download the installer file (Fluorescence Tracker.mlappinstall)
* Double-click on the installer file
* Click "Install" when prompted in MATLAB
* The app will then appear in the APPS tab in MATLAB
* The app source code can then be found in the installation folder specified by your MATLAB Add-Ons Preferences (or by querying the [app installation location](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/matlab.apputil.getinstalledappinfo.html))
* Please see the Fluorescence Tracker App User Guide for more information
